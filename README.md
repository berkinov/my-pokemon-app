# Welcome to My Reactjs Calculator
***
Here is my react https site look at the link https://lively-blancmange-9fd9f5.netlify.app/
## Task
I tried to solve all the problems that arose from the stackoverflow forum.

## Description
I tried to rewrite the code again until the project started working. And fantasized with styles)

## Installation
All the necessary packages are already installed, you will need to run the project, write the “npm start” command in the terminal.

## Usage
First install npm version 8.19.2 and use "npm i" command to initialize the project before checking it out please.
I do not know why, but without these commands it does not work.
